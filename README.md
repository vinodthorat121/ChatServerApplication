You have to write a program based on provided requirements. You are free to use a programming language of your choice, preferably Java. Please state all assumptions when implementing a solution. It is important to deliver elegant object-oriented code, apply design patterns and consider performance of the implementation. In addition, please provide JUnit test cases and comments for the implemented classes. Your delivered program should compile (provide all required jars) and run.
